Snake game written in Java language

This is a simple Java snake game I made.
Feel free to use it if you want, there's nothing special about it.

### Content
The game uses JPanel and Graphics to display content. I implemented KeyAdapter for the controls.
You can restart the game with space and navigate the snake with the arrow keys.
